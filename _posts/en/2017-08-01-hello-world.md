Welcome to my blog. Here I will publish technical posts and general thoughts about technology, with the hope that it can be useful for you.

My native language is Spanish, but the translation efforts are underway. If you can understand the language, the Spanish section of the blog has more content at this moment.

In the meantime, you could visit my [GitHub]( https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }} ) and check out my repositories. One of them [is a case study on automatically and horizontally scaling a webserver to the cloud](https://github.com/j-alvarez-moreno/proyecto-2ASIR) with Terraform, and it aims to solve the problem of a sudden and unexpected massive spike in web traffic that one has to be prepared to survive without offering a degraded experience to the end user.
